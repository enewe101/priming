Thesis: pre-task worker orientation can strongly
- prime workers
- generate different results

Park-dog coding task - pictures of national parks or something with people 
and animals

Priming Strategies:
1) Training excercise
	- stock photos with animals
	- stock photos without
	- random subset

2) Funder
	- National Park Service
	- McGill
	- Animal Health Org

3) Motivation / Description
	- City planning and how people view their surroundings
	- Animals and greenspace
	- strictly operational description

Studying lasting effects of priming
	- use 10 pictures
	- 3 orderings

Measured
	- effect of priming on k-top label ordering for the first pic
	- effect of priming on k-top labels for later pics (the lasting effect)

Guidelines to avoid priming:
	- Burn-in
	- diverse training






Treatments:
2 treatments per treatment set
3 sets
1 control treatment
~~~~
7 treatments

100 workers per treatment
x 7 treatments
~~~~~
700 worker-HITs

0.15 $ per worker-HIT
x 700 worker-HITs
~~~~~
210 $


analysis
- compare TF between different treatments.
- compare total vocabulary between different treatments, and between a 
	population comprised of 50 users from cultural and 50 users from ingredients




discussion

- make an ontology
- separately label things
- can we predict which set people were in - naive bayes
- idea of successive runs with clustering to gain specificity
- make an edgelist for the ontology
- comparing 
- temporal analysis, a figure:

	% |
	c |
	u |
	l |
	t |
	u |
	r |
	e |

- vacabulary - diversity
- vocabulary - specificity
- stroop test
- relative strength of priming pics vs funder
