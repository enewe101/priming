Intro
=====

We advocate thinking of this phenomenon as hysteresis.  Hysteresis is the 
tendency of a systems output to depend not only on its current inputs, but 
also on the history of those inputs.  It is employed in a wide variety of 
fields in the disciplines of physics, engineering, and economics.  
Understanding priming as a form of hysteresis provides the opportunity to apply
application-independant theoretical models of hysteresis to priming, and to
adapt knowledge from the other fields that have studied hysteretic systems.


About valence comparisons across images.
========================================

Overall, all images get more food-related words than culture-related ones.
This is not surprising because food is the central concrete object in the
images, whereas culture is abstract and only implied by the kinds of food.
It doesn't seem likely that a worker would fail to identify the images as 
containing food, but it seems likely that many would not be aware of the
culture implied by the specific dishes and symbols in the images.

Looking at the numbers of food- and culture-related words for each image, its
clear that on the whole, some images elecit more words of a particular 
orientation than others, regardless of which treatment we look at.  
For example, the first test image is closest to having balanced number of 
cultur- and food-oriented words,  while image 4 elicits the greatest absolute
excess of food-related words. 

It is 
intuitively appealing to say that these images are `inherently more cultural',
but of course, the relative culture- and food-signal in the labels is a 
property of both the images and overall population of workers.  With the 
understanding that it is shorthand, we will refer to images that elicit more 
cultural labels in the context of this experiment as having 
``more cultural signal''.

As one might expect, when comparing the CULT_img,x to the
other treatments, with respect to labels for the first test image, we see a 
dramatic excess of culture-orieted words, and a relative lack of food-related 
words.  But to what degree is this sustained throughout the test images?  
The CULT_img,x treatments do produce consistently less food-signal 
than and consistently more culture-signal compared to the AMBG treatment for 
all images.  But after the first image, these differences are slight, and 
taken individually do not give a $\alpha=0.95$ significance level. However when
pooled together, owing to the consistent direction of deviation
 (having always more culture- and less food-signal), these differences 
\textit{are} significant when pooled even if when we leave out the first image.

We take this to indicate that the main priming effect which drew the attention
of CULT_img,x workers toward culture is nearly erased after exposure to one
test image, although a residual effect remains.  One obstruction to this 
conclusion.

Having observed a strong effect due to image-based priming, do we see a
comparable effect for workers primed by being shown a fictitious funder name? 
Remarkably, the CULT_fund treatment produced consistently \textit{less} 
culture-signal as compared to AMBG for \textit{all} images.  This deviation is 
significant for images 3 and 4 as well as when we pool the labels for all 
images together \td{verify, make fig}.

The INGR_x,y treatments do not show significant deviations from AMBG in terms
of amount of cultural- or food-signal on a per image basis, but we do observe
significant differences when looking at the labels for all test images taken 
together.

About specificity comparison accross images
===========================================

- the treatments with non-ambiguous image sets, $\textsc{cult}_{img,x}$ and 
	$\textsc{ingr}_{img,x}$ have systematically lower specificity both overall
	and with respect to food, compared to $\textsc{ambg}

- In general, the variation in cultural specificity is much less.
	* this might be because we tend to have less nuanced cultural lexicon
		than food lexicon, with could be supported with evolutionary 
		psychology arguments.
	* It might be because culture is inherently a more abstract concept, and so
		it is more difficult to convey culturally specific notions through 
		images.
	# However, when both the framing, and in-task priming are culture-oriented
		( as in $\textsc{cult}_{fund,img}$) there \textit{is} significantly 
		more specificity than $\textsc{ambg}, as one would expect.


- The treatments $\textsc{cult}_{fund}$ and $\textsc{ingr}_{fund}$ tend to 
	have similar specificity to $\textsc{ambg}.  So, not only do the funding
	treatments have a weak effect on label orientation, they also have a 
	weak effect on specificity.  This is interesting, because the Naive Bayes 
	classifier demonstrates a high difference in priming ($\theta_\text{NB}$) 
	even though the difference doesn't manifest in the ways that one might 
	expect.  Perhaps the funder names do not affect orientation or 
	specificity at the conceptual level, but they influence the diction that 
	the worker chooses to express the same concepts.  Another possibility is 
	that these treatments affect the order in which labels are given, though
	without strongly affecting the selection of labels.  The classifier can 
	make use of this information, whereas tracing this effect it appart using 
	an ontology would be difficult.

- Perhaps the most striking effect is the pronounced decrease in specificity
	for the $\textsc{cult}_{img,x}$ treatments compared to both 
	$\texstsc{ambg}, $\textsc{cult}_{fund}$, and $\textsc{ingr}_{img}$.
	This loss of sensitivity manifests overall (panels A and B), but we can 
	see that it is mainly explained by a loss of specificity in food-oriented
	terms.  This result appears to be a clear case of 
	\textit{negative priming}, a phenomenon wherein a person ignores 
	non-salient percepts after repeated exposure.  Workers who are shown
	either the ambiguous or  ingredients priming image sets have already seen 
	five images consecutively that prominently feature food.  Upon arriving
	at the first test image, the fact that this image also contains food would
	probably not be considered salient anymore, since it doesn't distinguish
	that image from the others.  But for workers who have seen the culture
	image set, the first test image is the first one with any trace of food,
	so the generic label \texttt{food} would seem informative in that context.

- We see competing results.  On the one hand, the orientations are affected
	in the way one would expect.  On the other hand

- What can we say about the effect of framing on specificity?  On the one hand
	$\textsc{ingr}_{fund}$ did produce greater food specificity.  This seems 
	straightforward: upon seing that the funder is the ``National 
	Foundation for Nutritional Awareness'', one is inclined to interpret the
	task as a test of their awareness of nutrition.  On the other hand,
	$\textsc{cult}_{fund}$ did not produce in increase.  In fact, overall,
	it appears to have decreased specificity, although we would need a 
	statistically more porwerful test to be sure.  
	
	One reasonable explanation is that people are often discouraged 
	from explicitly noting cultural differences, even if they are benign*.
	We observed that the is that the label \texttt{racist}
	appeared several times in the dataset, which would seem to support view
	of workers perception of cultural distinction.  This label was elicited
	even though we believe the images to be free from any assertion of value
	in relation to a particular culture, positive or negative. 
	In any case, the result exhibits how the mechanisms of priming can be 
	complex, since after all, people are complex.
	
	* as footnote: the expression of cultural differences, even benign ones
	is discouraged by the well-founded social movement to suppress cultural 
	discrimination.  The worker base for AMT
	is mainly situated in the United States and India, so it seems reasonable
	to expect that many of these workers have been influenced by this movement.
