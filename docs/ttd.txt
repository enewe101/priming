Given the ontologies have been built for all of the images
- Do the orientation analysis on a per-image basis, as well as overall
- Do the specificity analysis on a per-image basis, as well as overall
	- should do proper significance tests.

Other stuff
- The classifier stuff should be reported in terms of theta (as well as F1)

- Do I need to take into account the variance of both the basis and subject
	population in the specificity comparisons?
