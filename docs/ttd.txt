- make sure that we can define a nbdataset that considers only specific images 
	for specific treatments
- make sure that we can get test sets that consider only specific images for 
	specific treatments

- run the classifier on the cultural and ingredients treatments, 
	on a per-image basis.
	- the output should be the accuracy for each class?
	- these tests will have output
		- accuracy on true-label-1 tests
		- accuracy on true-label-2 tests
		- overall precision on label-1 classification
		- overall recall on label-1 classification
		- F1-score on label-1 classification


- run the classifier on the cultural-image, cultural-funder, 
	cultural-image-funder treatments, all pairs, for the first pic, second,
	pic, etc

- concptualize the null-model for the specificity tests
- hypothesis test the results already generated
- consider comparisons between treatment variations (image, funder, both)
	for specificity in the first-picture labels
