- hypothesis testing for specificity
- methods
- plot 8 should compare cult_img and ingr_img instead of cult_img and ambg
- read *the future of crowd work*

Other stuff
===========
- Recalculate specificity
	- use 134 as the U sample size, and 67 as the V sample size
	- make sure to print running times, this will be long

- Change the specificity plots
	- plot on a meaningful scale # words more specific - # words less
	- plot the standard error (sqare root of eq8), not the 95% condfidence 
		interval
	- indicate significant measurements with stars -- calculate Stdev using
		eq 8!
	- discuss my hypothesis test with Derek

- am I using a consistent training and test size?

- the excess cultural orientation should be calculated with a fixed subsample
	from each treatment, because the treatments aren't the exact same size.


Might include
============
* never compared total vocab...
* compare total vocabulary between different treatments, and between a 
	population comprised of 50 users from cultural and 50 users from 
	ingredients
