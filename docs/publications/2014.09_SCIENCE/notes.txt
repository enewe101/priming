Prior to this study, little though was given to the ordering and bundling
of tasks.  But our findings show that intertask effects are far more powerful 
than other effects that are normally given consideration during task design.

One practical response to our findings would be to serve tasks in a random
order. In effect, this is an attempt to submerge the bias induced by 
intertask effects below the level of noise introduced by other uncontrolled 
factors.  Given the large
effect size, this is both not a prudent choice, and eschews the opportunity 
to engage a more refined task engineering practice, enabled by a better 
understanding of intertask effects.

The boost that we observed to the specialization and richness of workers' 
responses provides further motivation for developing a deeper understanding 
of the role that task ordering might play in a more sophisticated approach to 
task engineering.  One goal in using microtasks is to achieve expert level
judgments using non-expert participants.  This generally increases the 
throughput and decreases the cost in the application domain.  But aggregating 
many non-expert judgments cannot always produce expert level performance.

Perceptual learning is key to the development of expertise.  In many domains,
experts are distinguished from novices by their ability 
recognize salient from the non-salient information, more so than by their
knowledge of facts or rules.  Our observations show that repeated exposure to 
the task stimulus strongly influences the perception of salience.  does 
This suggests that a much more refined approach to task engineering might 
enable expert-level judgment for a wider variety of crowdsourced applications.
