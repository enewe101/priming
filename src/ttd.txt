# make data processer load images in the correct way for new data
	x test that it attributes images in the right way

# make the NB classifier calculate likelihood properly
	x sum of log probabilities
	x add one smoothing
	x make a tests with synthetic classification data

# make a cross-validator
	x test for proper data partitioning
	x test for proper performance on synthetic data

# Functional parts that need to be built:
 	x dataset adaptor: 
		x repackages clean dataset into class-sorted examples in the format
			expected by the naive bayes classifier cross validation test
		x allows one to select labels are included (i.e. labels attributed to
			which image). 

	x analysis function:
		x reads in old dataset
		x uses a dataset adaptor to take features associated to test0
		x performs cross validation on IMG-FOOD and IMG-CULT
		x repeats, using the new dataset

	x create a specificity tester for wordnet
		x map words from treatments A and B into respective synset counts
		x given a synset from A, how many synsets in B are ancester do it?
			descendant from it?
		x count ancester minus descendant for each synset in one example set

	x create a foodishness tester
		- synsets to include:
			food.n.02
			food.n.01
			helping.n.01
			taste.n.01
			taste.n.05
			taste.n.06
			taste.n.07


# What are the interesting analyses to do?
	old data:
		[] difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-CULT
		[] specificity testing, compare IMG-FOOD, IMG-CULT, IMG-INGR
			in the degree of specificity of their test-labels, and 
			measure the similarities of each of these to the testing images

	new data:
		[] difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
		[] difference in priming between FRM-FOOD and FRM-OBJ
		[] longitudinal difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
		[] fraction of food-related words in IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
			fraction of non-food-object-related words?
