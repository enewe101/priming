# check what was lost 
	? where is testing data now
		seems to be where it used to be.  New testing data is gone

	? are the files staged for delete actually deleted?
		No

# make data processer load images in the correct way for new data
	x test that it attributes images in the right way

# make the NB classifier calculate likelihood properly
	x sum of log probabilities
	x add one smoothing
	x make a tests with synthetic classification data

# make a cross-validator
	x test for proper data partitioning
	x test for proper performance on synthetic data

# Functional parts that need to be built:
 	x dataset adaptor: 
		- repackages clean dataset into class-sorted examples in the format
			expected by the naive bayes classifier cross validation test
		- allows one to select labels are included (i.e. labels attributed to
			which image). 

	x analysis function:
		- reads in old dataset
		- uses a dataset adaptor to take features associated to test0
		- performs cross validation on IMG-FOOD and IMG-CULT
		- repeats, using the new dataset

# What are the interesting analyses to do?
	old data:
		[] difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-CULT
		[] specificity testing, compare IMG-FOOD, IMG-CULT, IMG-INGR
			in the degree of specificity of their test-labels, and 
			measure the similarities of each of these to the testing images

	new data:
		[] difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
		[] difference in priming between FRM-FOOD and FRM-OBJ
		[] longitudinal difference in priming between IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
		[] fraction of food-related words in IMG-FOOD and IMG-OBJ
			fraction of non-food-object-related words?
