Examples of good spelling correction:
crepes,crepe # ignore pluralization
bibimbapp, bibimbap # 
firstclass, first_class
saladbole, salad bowl


Context dependant!  Either could be right, depending whether you think
the intended meaning was actually "restroom" or "left room"
reftroom, restroom # a plausible correction
reftroom, left room # an alternate plausible correction for the same item
allnice, allspice # "all nice" makes sense, but "allspice" is a kind of spice


These are examples of words that are probably not correct.
crepes, creep # 
bibimbapp, bib im bap # "bibimbap" is a dish.  "bib im bap" seems unlikely
firstclass, first_pass # "firstclass
saladbole, salad bone
